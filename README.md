# Supervised Learning projects (in Spanish)

By: Fernando Gomez Perera

Academic projects where I applied Supervised Learning to analyze distinct datasets.

The main project consisted on applying different models for one dataset. The other ones used only one model for one dataset.

These projects where developed using Python or R.
